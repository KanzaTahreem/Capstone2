# JavaScript Capstone - API-based webapp

> The JavaScript capstone project is build on [MealDB](www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?c=Seafood), an external API, and an [Involvement API](https://www.notion.so/Involvement-API-869e60b5ad104603aa6db59e08150270) which is used to record the user interactions including likes, and comments.

-     The main page shows a list or a collection of meals (retrieved from an ¬≠external API) that you can like.
-     A popup window with more data about an item that you can use to comment on the different meals and also see a list of comments.
-     In the pop-up window you can see the main ingredients, needed for each recipe, a procedure  to follow for the preparation of each meal.
-     The popup window consists of two buttons, one that connects to a YouTube video explaining  step-by-step of each recipe, and another one that links to official website.
-     The application shows the number of likes and comments for each meals.
