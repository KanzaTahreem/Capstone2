# Capstone2
 
We built a web application based on an external API:
-   	The main page shows a list or a collection of products (retrieved from an ­external API) that you can “like”
-   	A popup window with more data about an item that you can use to comment on the products and also see a list of comments
-   	The application shows the number of likes and comments for each product
­
