# Capstone2
 
We built a web application based on an external API:
-   	The main page shows a list or a collection of meals (retrieved from an ­external API) that you can “like”
-   	A popup window with more data about an item that you can use to comment on the different meals and also see a list of comments.
-    in the pop-up window you can see the main ingredients needed for each recipe and a procedure to follow for the preparation of each recipe or meal
-    additionally, in the same pop-up window, we have a button that connects a YouTube video explaining the step-by-step of each recipe
-    and also in the pop-up window, we have another button that connects the website where all that recipe is from
-   	The application shows the number of likes and comments for each meals
